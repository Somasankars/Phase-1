# Air Quality Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze air quality data to better understand air pollution trends, identify pollution hotspots, and build predictive models for RSPM/PM10 levels. The project follows a Design Thinking approach to ensure user-centric problem-solving.

## Design Thinking Approach

### Empathize
- Identify project stakeholders, including environmental agencies, researchers, and policymakers.
- Understand their specific needs and concerns regarding air quality analysis.

### Define
- Define project objectives based on stakeholder input:
  - Objective 1: Understand the impact of air quality on public health.
  - Objective 2: Identify the major sources of air pollution.
  - Objective 3: Develop actionable recommendations to improve air quality.

### Ideate
- Brainstorm potential solutions, data sources, and analysis techniques.
- Encourage creativity and innovative thinking within the team.

### Prototype (Plan the Analysis Approach)
- Create a detailed plan that includes:
  - Data Sources: Identify data sources (e.g., sensors, government databases).
  - Data Collection: Define data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
  - Analysis Techniques: Choose statistical and machine learning methods.
  - Model Development: If applicable, outline model selection and training steps.
  - Visualization Techniques: Plan visualizations for effective communication.

### Test and Get Feedback
- Share the analysis plan with stakeholders and gather feedback.
- Make adjustments based on the feedback received.

### Implement
- Execute the analysis approach, keeping stakeholders informed of progress.
- Collect, preprocess, analyze, and visualize data according to the plan.

### Iterate
- Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the analysis approach.
- Be open to making methodological adjustments as needed.

### Visualize
- Select appropriate visualizations based on analysis results and insights:
  - Line charts for air quality trends.
  - Heatmaps for pollution hotspot visualization.
  - Bar charts for location comparisons.
  - Scatter plots for parameter relationships.

### Test and Validate Visualizations
- Ensure chosen visualizations effectively convey insights.
- Adjust and refine visualizations based on stakeholder feedback.

### Communicate Results
- Present analysis results to stakeholders using selected visualizations.
- Provide actionable recommendations and insights addressing project objectives.
